# 🥔 PotatoDB

Welcome to **PotatoDB** — the in-memory key-value store that’s as simple as a baked potato, but much faster to digest. (made as experiment for go-concurrency course)

No complex setup, no heavy dependencies — just throw your keys and values in, and PotatoDB will keep them warm for you.

## Features

- 🚀 **Fast** — everything lives in memory.  
- 🥔 **Lightweight** — fewer lines of code than your grandma’s potato recipe.  
- 🔑 **Easy API** — set, get, delete. That’s it.  
- 🧹 **(Future)** Time-to-live for your values (because even potatoes expire).

git clone https://github.com/kirban/potato-db.git

## Usage

---
## Roadmap

📝 Persistence to disk (because RAM can’t hold all the potatoes forever).

🥔 Concurrency support (so multiple chefs can cook at once).

🔮 Fancy queries (hash browns, mashed potatoes, you name it).
